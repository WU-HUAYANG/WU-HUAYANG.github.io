## Welcome to the Interactive Robotics Lab Website!

Our lab focuses on **physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI)**, aiming to create robots that work alongside humans in various applications. Our research spans multiple domains, including:

- **Collaborative Robots (Co-Robots) for Industrial Applications**  
  Developing control strategies to enable robots to perform tasks such as polishing and grinding in manufacturing environments, improving efficiency and quality.

- **Upper-Limb Rehabilitation and Human Motor Control Modeling**  
  Designing robotic systems to aid in the recovery of motor function for individuals with upper-limb impairments. This includes investigating the mechanisms of human motor control to develop more intuitive, adaptive, and personalized therapy solutions.

- **Lower-Limb Exoskeletons**  
  Creating wearable robotic devices to assist individuals with mobility challenges, enhancing their independence and quality of life.

Our interdisciplinary approach integrates robotics, biomechanics, and control theory to address real-world challenges in human-robot collaboration.
