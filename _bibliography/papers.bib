abstract = {Abstract This paper addresses the high-precision control problem for nonlinear strict feedback systems with external time-varying disturbances and proposes a novel composite learning control algorithm. Unlike previous research that only uses tracking errors for neural network updates, this paper prioritizes the accuracy of neural network learning. The article uses a selective memory recursive least squares algorithm to construct system information prediction errors, which are combined with tracking errors to update the neural network weights. A new composite learning control algorithm is developed to design dynamic surface control and neural network disturbance observers, which achieves high-precision control of nonlinear strict feedback systems under external time-varying disturbance conditions. Lyapunov's method demonstrates the stability of the closed-loop system and the boundedness of errors. The simulation results show that the proposed control algorithm can effectively estimate system nonlinearity and suppress the impact of disturbances.},

  abstract={Recent advances in physiological human motor control research indicate that human endpoint stiffness magnitude increases linearly with grasp force. Based on these findings, a scheme was proposed in this paper to integrate the linear quadratic estimation (LQE) filter with the stiffness model inferred from grasp force, which can simultaneously estimate the human arm’s stiffness and motion intention. Then, an online variable impedance controller (VIC) was designed based on previous estimations for physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). The proposed stiffness model and estimation method were validated through experiments using a planar robotic interface. In order to assess its performance in practical pHRI tasks, the implementation of human arm stiffness and intention estimation combining with VIC was extended to a teleoperation peg-in-hole and robot-assisted rehabilitation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively estimate human motion intention and arm stiffness simultaneously. Compared to existing methods, the proposed VIC enhances pHRI in terms of increased flexibility, effective guidance, and reduced human effort.},

  abstract={Human–robot collaboration systems aim to improve working efficiency and reduce human workload. However, inefficient assimilation of human potential behaviors often leads to increasing human–robot conflicts. In this article, a motion optimization approach integrating behavior inference is presented for physical human–robot-environment interaction (pHREI) tasks to implement assistive behavior. A multistep human behaviors model with long short-term memory (LSTM) mechanism is employed, enabling continuous prediction of the human intention based on robot and environment states. A two-layer control scheme is developed to optimize the manipulator trajectory with the objective of reducing human workload in a model predictive control (MPC) fashion. A series of experiments is conducted to verify the proposed scheme on a wood-sawing task. With the integration of the human and environment model, the proposed control scheme significantly reduces the human workload while eliminating the human–robot conflict simultaneously.},

  abstract={Human-robot collaboration is a common paradigm of physical human-robot interaction, typically involving human users transferring their expertise in performing repetitive tasks to the robot. However, conventional methods, such as programming by demonstration and learning from demonstration, are not able to yield accurate tracking performance and do not allow robot behavior modifications on an online basis. In order to overcome such deficiencies, iterative learning control is employed to attain improved tracking accuracy, while the trial-by-trial modification in accordance with the physical interaction is also allowed. Further, in terms of the varying trial lengths during the collaboration, dynamic time warping is integrated to align the multiple trial paths, while the convergence of spatial errors is ensured. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in collaborative tasks.},

Given the difficulty in obtaining analytical models of operators, a Gaussian process regression is introduced to construct a data-driven model for operator behaviors. To improve the performance of the multi- area interconnected power system, a shared control approach with an operational model is presented, which integrates grid state information and operator instructions.

  abstract={Contour accuracy is crucial for machining precision in five-axis computer numerical control (CNC) machining. This paper addresses the challenge of improving contour accuracy by proposing a novel contour error estimation and compensation method based on dynamic time warping (DTW). By incorporating time information and geometric characteristics of the machining path, the proposed method introduces a multiple-information fusion algorithm to define distance characteristics between the planned and actual trajectory sequences. This allows the calculation of a distortion path and the establishment of a mapping model between the two sequences. To mitigate the effect of DTW singularity on contour error estimation, a mapping model is established between line segments to determine reference points. The position contour error and the direction contour error of the five-axis tool are accurately estimated using segmented Hermite interpolation, and a spatial iterative learning framework is employed to compensate for them. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in dealing with estimation errors in complex trajectories and its good performance in improving contour accuracy. Note to Practitioners—This paper proposes an effective strategy for the estimation of contour errors in five-axis machining. Currently, most methods for contour error estimation in five-axis machining are based on the nearest point principle. However, this approach fails to accurately estimate contour errors for complex trajectories with significant curvature variations, leading to ineffective contour error compensation in subsequent stages. Therefore, we introduce a contour error estimation algorithm based on DTW. This algorithm takes into account the time information and geometric features of the machining path. Experimental results validate the feasibility and advantages of this approach.},

  pages={1-13},
  abstract={In radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)-based real-time learning tasks, forgetting mechanisms are widely used such that the neural network can keep its sensitivity to new data. However, with forgetting mechanisms, some useful knowledge will get lost simply because they are learned a long time ago, which we refer to as the passive knowledge forgetting phenomenon. To address this problem, this article proposes a real-time training method named selective memory recursive least squares (SMRLS) in which the classical forgetting mechanisms are recast into a memory mechanism. Different from the forgetting mechanism, which mainly evaluates the importance of samples according to the time when samples are collected, the memory mechanism evaluates the importance of samples through both temporal and spatial distribution of samples. With SMRLS, the input space of the RBFNN is evenly divided into a finite number of partitions, and a synthesized objective function is developed using synthesized samples from each partition. In addition to the current approximation error, the neural network also updates its weights according to the recorded data from the partition being visited. Compared with classical training methods including the forgetting factor recursive least squares (FFRLS) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods, SMRLS achieves improved learning speed and generalization capability, which are demonstrated by corresponding simulation results.},

  abstract={In human–robot collaboration (HRC) tasks, the role of the robot should be naturally and smoothly transitioned between the leader and the follower to guarantee task performance. To realize this, the arbitration of the shared control between the human and the robot needs to be properly designed to assign a degree of leadership to the robot. In this article, we propose a fuzzy logic-based arbitration rule with the help of Kalman filter. Based on this rule, the arbitration can be continuously regulated between zero and one according to the interaction force and the velocity of the human–robot collaboration system with human intention taken into account. Besides, the distance between the system and the obstacle and more generally the environment is also served as a fuzzy input, so that the possible interaction with the environment, e.g., obstacle avoidance, can be considered to ensure system safety. Since our proposed arbitration rule is based on a fuzzy logic, it endows the robot with the capability of continuous reasoning without an explicit form. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by experiments.},

Then, an uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE)-based controller using radial basis function (RBF) neural network is developed to address the issue of integral windup. To overcome the issue of passive knowledge forgetting, the selective memory recursive least squares weight update law is adopted. Moreover, the stability of the closed-loop system is demonstrated. A combined control scheme, incorporating RADAPI hysteresis inverse model feedforward compensation along with RBF-UDE based closed-loop feedback control, is devised to enhance the trajectory tracking accuracy of PEAs. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results are provided to validate the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract={Large-area tactile sensing for robotic manipulators is an important capability to enable robots to perceive interactions with environment around them and for intuitive human–robot collaboration. In this article, we introduce a novel vision-based tactile sensing methodology that employs electroluminescent (EL) panels with a deformable soft skin that modulates light intensity based on applied forces to realize force localization and magnitude estimation for multipoint contact scenarios. The tactile sensing module is composed of a transparent rigid skeleton, a sensing skin composed of a thin and flexible EL panel, a deformable translucent elastomer layer with a pyramid pattern and an opaque outer layer. When a force is applied onto the skin, the deformable layer deforms modulating the intensity of light passing through the transparent layer which is detected by a camera embedded inside the module. We utilize image processing, camera models, and statistical fitting to localize single and multiple touch points as well as estimate the magnitude of the forces applied. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested with five different indenters, and the localization error and the intensity-force mapping are analyzed. A localization accuracy of 6.63 mm has been achieved and normal forces from 3.1 to 9.4 N can be detected with an accuracy of 9.3%–11.7% error range. This work provides a simple and effective solution for the acquisition of position and force magnitude information in human–robot interaction tasks such as guidance and demonstration.},

  abstract={This article investigates the problem of attitude stabilization for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the presence of parametric uncertainties, control input saturation, and external disturbances. Two robust adaptive control strategies, i.e., bounded adaptive control (BAC) and asymptotical adaptive control (AAC) are developed, respectively, where the construction of saturation auxiliary system and the design of adaptive laws for parameters and disturbance's bound are considered. As a result, the compensation of input saturation, the estimation of physical parameters, and the suppression of external disturbance are achieved. In BAC, the real attitude tracking error is guaranteed to converge to a neighborhood of zero, and its transient performance is constrained to an explicit bounded range. In AAC, the real attitude tracking error is proved to be asymptotically stable, and its transient bound in terms of $L_{2}$ norm is derived by constructing an auxiliary equation, which is a computable bound. The simulation is carried out to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed two control techniques.},

  abstract={One promising function of interactive robots is to provide a specific interaction force to human users. For example, rehabilitation robots are expected to promote patients' recovery by interacting with them with a prescribed force. However, motion uncertainties of different individuals, which are hard to predict due to the varying motion speed and noises during motion, degrade the performance of existing control methods. This article proposes a method to learn a desired reference trajectory for a robot based on dynamic motion primitives (DMPs) and iterative learning (IL). By controlling the robot to follow the generated desired reference trajectory, the interaction force can achieve a desired value. In our proposed approach, DMPs are first employed to parameterize the demonstration trajectories of the human user. Then, a recursive least square (RLS)-based estimator is developed and combined with the Adam optimization method to update the trajectory parameters so that the desired reference trajectory of the robot is iteratively obtained by resolving the DMPs. Since the proposed method parameterizes the trajectories depending on the phase variable, it removes the essential assumption of traditional IL methods that the iteration period should be invariant, and thus, has improved robustness compared with the existing methods. Experiments are performed using an interactive robot to validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.},

  abstract={This article presents a path learning method through physical human–robot interaction (pHRI) based on a stretch-compression iterative learning control (ILC) scheme and contouring impedance control. The robot learns a task path desired by the human user through a kinaesthetic interface and provides physical assistance to the human user in repetitive interactions. Due to the uncertainty of the human user’s force and motion, the time duration of each iteration may be different, so a novel ILC scheme based on stretch and compression operation is proposed to update the reference trajectory of the robotic manipulator. By attaching the Frenet–Serret frame to each point on the reference path, the control task is decomposed into impedance control in the tangential direction and position control in the normal or binormal direction constraining the human user on the reference path. Experiments on a 7-DOF Sawyer robot are carried out to show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Assist-as-needed (AAN) is a paradigm in rehabilitation robotics based on the fact that more active participation from human users promotes faster recovery of motor functions. Moreover, the patients and public engaged and involved in our research design stressed that in order to provide safe and patient-friendly assistance, rehabilitation robotics should be equipped with different constraints while giving minimal assistance where required. Most of the current constraint-based AAN methods are only capable of providing position or velocity constraints which limit the quality of assistance that the robotic systems could provide. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective optimization (MOO) based controller which can implement both linear and non-linear constraints to improve the quality of assistance. This MOO-based proposed controller includes not only position and velocity constraints but also a vibration constraint to subside the tremors common in rehabilitation patients. The performance of this controller is compared with a Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) based controller with task-space constraints in a simulation. The results indicate that the MOO-based controller behaves similarly to the BLF-based controller in terms of position constraints. It also shows that the MOO-based controller can improve the quality of assistance by constraining the velocity and subsiding the simulated tremors.},

  abstract={Previous works have developed impedance control to increase safety and improve performance in contact tasks, where the robot is in physical interaction with either an environment or a human user. This article investigates impedance learning for a robot guided by a human user while interacting with an unknown environment. We develop automatic adaptation of robot impedance parameters to reduce the effort required to guide the robot through the environment, while guaranteeing interaction stability. For nonrepetitive tasks, this novel adaptive controller can attenuate disturbances by learning appropriate robot impedance. Implemented as an iterative learning controller, it can compensate for position dependent disturbances in repeated movements. Experiments demonstrate that the robot controller can, in both repetitive and nonrepetitive tasks: first, identify and compensate for the interaction, second, ensure both contact stability (with reduced tracking error) and maneuverability (with less driving effort of the human user) in contact with real environments, and third, is superior to previous velocity-based impedance adaptation control methods.},

  abstract={Robot-aided bilateral treatment has been verified to be an effective training program for hemiplegic rehabilitation. In this article, a reference-free active control framework based on optimal trajectory deformation is proposed to ensure the safety requirements in the leader–follower paradigm of bilateral treatment. A constrained optimization method is developed to handle the motion constraints, which are constructed by quantitative assessments of typical impairment in stroke patients, such as reduced range of motion, resistance to passive movement, and disturbed quality of movement. Then, by optimally deforming the robotic trajectory, abnormal motion patterns that lead to safety issues can be rectified. Furthermore, the physically interactive trajectory deformation is employed to achieve active control without a predefined trajectory. At last, all approaches are verified on a robotic platform with a 2-DoF lower-limb exoskeleton. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed control scheme in rectifying abnormal motion patterns and enhancing human–robot interaction.},

Second, to regulate the assistive follower robot (AFR), we provide an efficient technique to acquire the correct orientation to achieve holding. In addition, we devise an adjustable artificial potential field method to autonomously regulate AFR's position to a ready-to-hold position, where the operator's motion is involved. At last, based on the combination of the autoregressive model and the impedance model, we generate a reference trajectory for AFR to follow, which enables the followers to hold a rigid or a deformable object with a desired contact force.

First, a support vector machine combined with least squares is developed to recognize the desired path based on human guidance. Second, VGs are designed based on the admittance control for human–robot collaborative path following, which combine the human's decision-making with the robot's accurate execution capability. The effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed method are verified on a 7-DOF Sawyer robot equipped with a force/torque sensor.},

  abstract={Finite/fixed-time control yields a promising tool to optimize a system's settling time, but lacks the ability to separately define the settling time and the convergence domain (known as practically prescribed-time stability, PPTS). We provide a sufficient condition for PPTS based on a new piecewise exponential function, which decouples the settling time and convergence domain into separately user-defined parameters. We propose an adaptive event-triggered prescribed-time control scheme for nonlinear systems with asymmetric output constraints, using an exponential-type barrier Lyapunov function. We show that this PPTS control scheme can guarantee tracking error convergence performance, while restricting the output state according to the prescribed asymmetric constraints. Compared with traditional finite/fixed-time control, the proposed methodology yields separately user-defined settling time and convergence domain without the prior information on disturbance. Moreover, asymmetric state constraints can be handled in the control structure through bias state transformation, which offers an intuitive analysis technique for general constraint issues. Simulation and experiment results on a heterogeneous teleoperation system demonstrate the merits of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract={Micro air vehicles' (MAVs) movements can be significantly affected by physical contact with unknown moving objects (UMOs) from a random direction. To address this problem, low-latency sensors (cameras or radars) and high-speed processors are installed in six directions of aerial vehicles. However, this method is limited by hardware costs, load, and energy. In this article, a fast recovery strategy for MAVs is proposed, which is inspired by the recovery manoeuvre of mosquitoes hit by raindrops. When hit by falling raindrops, mosquitoes will descend along the falling direction of raindrops to gradually counteract the kinetic energy of the impact induced by the raindrops. During the descent, mosquitoes will gradually tilt to one side but move in the opposite direction, and finally deviate from the falling route of raindrops. To simulate the recovery strategy, a micro aerial robot called RobMos is designed. The RobMos is an overactuated system that can decouple the position control from the attitude control. Using the recovery strategy, the robot can quickly recover to a stable attitude after being impacted by UMOs. An onboard inertial measurement unit is used to estimate the impact location. Finally, the prototype can bear the impact of objects that are two times its own weight. Moreover, the generalizability of this strategy is also discussed, and it is proved that the RobMos can even recover attitude after being hit by the UMO in a lateral direction.},

  abstract={A popular path learning method is to use off-line programming by demonstration (PbD) to plan a rough path, but it is subjected to uncertainties in the environment so needs to be updated during the task execution. For this purpose, a spatial iterative learning control (sILC) is developed to learn an accurate path through intuitive online correction based on human-robot interaction (HRI). To improve the efficiency and accuracy of the path learning, a visual assistance system is added to HRI, which helps the robot to find the initial path point and complement the correction of the learning error. This method mitigates the requirement on classic ILC that the time period should be consistent in the repetitive interaction task and utilizes the complementary advantages of vision and force sensing, thus addressing the limitations of the vision-based or HRI methods. The rigorous proof of learning convergence and the results of the simulation and experiments on a 7-degree-of-freedom (DoF) Sawyer robot platform illustrate the significance and advantages of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners—The problem of accurate path learning of robotic manipulators is addressed in this paper, which is found in ample applications such as welding and laser cutting. When the required path is irregular, it is difficult to define it based on offline programming and calibration. This paper presents a new human-robot interactive learning framework, in which the interaction force and machine vision are combined with sILC to achieve online detection and correction for learning and tracking an unknown path. This framework leads to an intuitive human-robot collaboration system where the human operator can fine tune the robot’s motion through direct physical interaction, and at the same time the robot improves its tracking performance automatically based on visual servoing.},

  title={Five-Axis Contour Error Control Based on Spatial Iterative Learning},

  pages={112-123},
  abstract={In this paper, a contour error control strategy based on spatial iterative learning control (sILC) is developed for repetitive processing of five-axis computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools. A curve approximation method with an adaptive moving window is developed to achieve accurate tool position and orientation contour error estimation, and a five-axis contour error control strategy based on sILC is proposed. The compensation method is derived using an sILC algorithm to modify the geometric reference path instead of modifying the controller. The experimental results show that the proposed control strategy reduces contour errors of five-axis CNC machine tools, and it outperforms the traditional tracking error control. Note to Practitioners—This paper aims to propose an effective five-axis contour error control scheme. At present, most of the five-axis contour error control methods rely on the modification of the controller, which is not allowed in commercial CNC systems. Therefore, we propose a five-axis contour error compensation algorithm based on sILC, which modifies the system’s reference path. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the five-axis contour errors, while maintaining the machining efficiency.},
